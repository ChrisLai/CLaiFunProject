								Zealots are lower-ranked Templar who have yet to reach the upper levels 
								of the Khala. Each zealot is trained for decades in hand-to-hand combat, 
								tactics, pain tolerance and martial discipline. Zealots are taught to hate 
								their enemies with a white hot passion and to hunt them down without mercy. 
								Through the path of the Khala, zealots learn to hone their innate battle rage 
								to a fine edge,though they can invoke a near-berserker rage when in battle 
								if need be. They form the backbone of the protoss military.
